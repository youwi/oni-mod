Use command line arguments. To find the name of the allocator parameters you want to change, check the list of allocator settings the Editor and players print when they start up. For example, to change the block size of the main heap allocators, use -memorysetup-main-allocator-block-size=<new_value>

Tip: To ensure your settings improve performance, profile the application before and after making changes. See the Profiler overview page for more information. You can also check the memory usage reports. They are available in the log
